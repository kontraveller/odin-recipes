# odin-recipes
First Odin project: Recipes

Goal of the project was to make my very first own web-site with different pages, links, lists and images. Along the way I'd be using Git, GitHub, Command line and Visual Studio Code.
Thoughts after the project was finished:
Building the site was fun. I used recipes I'd found online. Nothing caused any major problems.
Before every step, I revisited TOP's previous lessons for a reminder.
Project was a great way to put to use everything previously learned.
Especially the use of GitHub and Git, which were a little unclear before, seem now much more understandable.
Things to improve:
Commit comments. And when to commit. I could have used Git's tools more often, after every logical point (added code), with a good comment to keep the work flow easy to read and follow.
